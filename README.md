🧩 Interactive Quiz Game – Unity

🎮 Project Overview

This project is a fully functional interactive quiz experience built from scratch in Unity using the Canvas UI system.

It challenges players with dynamic questions, real-time scoring, and timed responses — all integrated with a smooth and polished interface powered by TextMeshPro and Button components.

The project focuses on mastering Unity’s UI workflow, state management, and real-time feedback systems to deliver an engaging, responsive gameplay experience.

🧠 Concepts & Systems Implemented

Dynamic Question System

• Randomized question selection with multiple-choice answers.

• Modular design for easy expansion of the question database.

Real-Time Scoring System

• Automatic score updates based on correct answers.

• Supports cumulative scoring logic for multiple rounds.

Timer & Visual Countdown

• Interactive countdown timer using Unity UI.

• Time penalties or rewards based on player actions.

Progress Tracking

• Smooth slider-based progress bar that reflects current quiz stage.

• End-sequence triggered dynamically on quiz completion.

Polished User Interface

• Built with TextMeshPro, Buttons, and Sliders.

• Used Canvas groups and anchor presets for clean, responsive layouts.

🚀 Key Learnings & Technical Skills

• Mastered Unity’s Canvas UI workflow and responsive screen design.

• Implemented state management for smooth quiz flow transitions.

• Designed interactive gameplay logic with event-driven programming.

• Created custom timer systems and progress-tracking mechanisms ⏱️.

• Improved UI/UX design through visual consistency and user feedback.

Used Header and SerializeField attributes for organized scripts and editor clarity.

🧭 Design Process

Before coding, a previsualization canvas was created to plan the UI layout — mapping the placement of buttons, text, and sliders.
This helped achieve a clean, readable, and well-structured interface design.

Gameplay Flow:
🟦 Question Display → 🟨 Answer Selection → 🟩 Progress Tracking → 🟧 Score Update → 🟥 End Sequence
