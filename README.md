🧩 Interactive Quiz Game – Unity

🎮 Project Overview

This project is a fully functional interactive quiz experience built from scratch in Unity using the Canvas UI system.

It challenges players with dynamic questions, real-time scoring, and timed responses — all integrated with a smooth and polished interface powered by TextMeshPro and Button components.

The project focuses on mastering Unity’s UI workflow, state management, and real-time feedback systems to deliver an engaging, responsive gameplay experience.

🧠 Concepts & Systems Implemented

Dynamic Question System

Randomized question selection with multiple-choice answers.

Modular design for easy expansion of the question database.

Real-Time Scoring System

Automatic score updates based on correct answers.

Supports cumulative scoring logic for multiple rounds.

Timer & Visual Countdown

Interactive countdown timer using Unity UI.

Time penalties or rewards based on player actions.

Progress Tracking

Smooth slider-based progress bar that reflects current quiz stage.

End-sequence triggered dynamically on quiz completion.

Polished User Interface

Built with TextMeshPro, Buttons, and Sliders.

Used Canvas groups and anchor presets for clean, responsive layouts.

🚀 Key Learnings & Technical Skills

Mastered Unity’s Canvas UI workflow and responsive screen design.

Implemented state management for smooth quiz flow transitions.

Designed interactive gameplay logic with event-driven programming.

Created custom timer systems and progress-tracking mechanisms ⏱️.

Improved UI/UX design through visual consistency and user feedback.

Used Header and SerializeField attributes for organized scripts and editor clarity.

🧭 Design Process

Before coding, a previsualization canvas was created to plan the UI layout — mapping the placement of buttons, text, and sliders.
This helped achieve a clean, readable, and well-structured interface design.

Gameplay Flow:
🟦 Question Display → 🟨 Answer Selection → 🟩 Progress Tracking → 🟧 Score Update → 🟥 End Sequence

🤖 Future Enhancement (AI-Driven Quiz Master)

Next goal: train an AI “Quiz Master” using Reinforcement Learning (Q-learning or lightweight DQN).

The AI dynamically adjusts question difficulty based on player performance.

Rewards are given for maintaining optimal engagement and response times.

This creates a personalized quiz experience that adapts to each player’s skill level.
