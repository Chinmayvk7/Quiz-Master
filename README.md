Built this interactive quiz experience from scratch using Unity's Canvas UI system, featuring:

✅ Dynamic question system with multiple-choice answers.

✅ Real-time scoring system.

✅ Interactive timer with visual countdown.

✅ Progress tracking with slider-based progress bar.

✅ Polished UI using TextMeshPro and Button components.


🚀 Key learnings from this project:

• Mastered Unity's Canvas UI workflow and responsive design.

• Implemented game state management for quiz flow.

• Created smooth user interactions with button events.

• Developed timer systems and progress tracking ⏱️ .

• Enhanced UI/UX design skills with cohesive visual elements .

• Leveraged header attributes to keep the name tags, variables and scripts organized.

📍Before I started developing the game, I created a sample previsualization canvas to map out the UI layout. This blueprint helped organize the positioning of buttons, sliders, and text for clean and structured 
layout management.

🔹Question display → Answer selection → Progress tracking → Score updates → Ending sequence

- Train an AI “quiz master” that learns to select the next question difficulty based on how well the player performs.
  
- The RL agent (using Q-learning or a lightweight Deep Q-Network) gets rewards when player engagement/time-on-question is optimal.

- The system automatically “personalizes” question flow for each player.
